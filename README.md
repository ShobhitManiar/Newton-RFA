# Newton-RFA
Root finding using Newton Raphson Method
This is a C++ program that uses Newton’s method as a root-finding algorithm to find the earliest time at which the force on the robot is zero.

For the robot to perform its natural task it needs to exercise countering force. Therefore, it is necessary to find the earliest time at which the force acting on it 
becomes null. The root-finding algorithm such as Newton’s method is effective in predicting successive approximates of time for the given time-varying force. To get better approximates the convergence criteria can be tuned.
Utilizing polymorphic function wrapper that invoke a lambda expression to enable passing different functions and their derivatives in when creating objects of a class.
